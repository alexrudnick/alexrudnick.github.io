<h1>Alex Rudnick: CV</h1>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Machine translation. Natural language processing and machine learning.
Open Source. Expanding access to the world's information through human language
technology and education.</p>

<h2>Current research</h2>
<p>
Broadly, my research is about improving machine translation for the world's
under-resourced languages. I am working on helping systems make better word
choices through word-sense disambiguation techniques, concretely focusing on the
Spanish-Guarani language pair. This involves both gathering more training data
through crowdsourcing and making better use of the resources that we already
have available.
</p>

that uses machine learning to model the listener's preferences and play songs in
an appropriate order, based on signal features extracted from the songs and
their ID3 metadata. Updated the interface and functionality to convert between
sound formats, helped clean up existing code.
</p>

<h3>Learning By Design group</h3>
<p>
<i>Summer 2005 to Spring 2006.</i>
