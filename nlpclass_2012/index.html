<h2>Homeworks</h2>
<p>Probably the most important part of the class is the homeworks. Spend some
time on them. They are lovingly hand-crafted, or perhaps lifted from other NLP
classes that I think are good. They were lovingly hand-crafted by
<em>somebody!</em></p>

<p>Homeworks are due an hour before class on Thursdays, usually every other
Thursday. "Homework pings" are due a week in advance, just to make sure
everybody gets started.</p>
