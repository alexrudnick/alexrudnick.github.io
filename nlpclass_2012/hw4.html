<h1>hw4: tagging and introduction to parsing</h1>

<h2>about this assignment</h2>

<p>
We started this assignment with the <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/b490nlp/tagging-in-class-exercise">in-class
exercise on October 9</a>.
</p>

<h2>part 1: finish your tagger!</h2>
<p>
Make the tagger that we started in the in-class exercise work! All the changes
you have to make are in <tt>hmm_trellis.py</tt>, so that's the only file you
have to turn in. Unless you make some other changes. <em>(this part is due for
the homework ping on Thursday 18 October!)</em>
</p>

<h2>part 2: naive chart parser</h2>
<p>
Take the following grammar:
</p>

<pre>
S -> NP VP           NP -> people
VP -> V NP           NP -> fish
VP -> VP PP          NP -> tanks
NP -> NP PP          NP -> rods
NP -> NP NP          V -> people
PP -> P NP           V -> fish
                     V -> tanks
                     P -> with
</pre>

<p>Implement a CKY parser that can return all parses for "people fish tanks",
"people fish with rods", and "people fish tanks with rods". CKY parsing is
described at the beginning of Chapter 13 in Jurafsky and Martin! There's nice
pseudocode that you can use on page 440. We'll build this live in class on
Thursday 18 October.</p>

<h2>HARD MODE</h2>

<p>More things to try!</p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>any HARD MODE option from the page about the tagging exercise:</b>
  Add better smoothing. Or do a thorough job of evaluating the tagger. Or see
  how well your tagger does against somebody else's!
  </li>

  <li><b>Use a different programming language</b>: Show us your lambdas. Or is
  this not Enterprise enough for you? Java it up!
  </li>

  <li><b>Build a broader-coverage grammar</b>: Get some sentences from the wild
  (just a few!) and write grammar rules that allow you to parse them. How many
  possible parses are there, for your real-world sentence, with your grammar?
  <em>(recommended.)</em>
  </li>
  </ul>

<h2>turning it in</h2>

<p>Turn in your <tt>hmm_trellis.py</tt>, whatever code you write for your CKY
parser, and a text file <tt>hw4.txt</tt>, describing how to run your parser,
and any thoughts, questions, difficulties, or HARD MODE extensions you'd like
to discuss. Use Oncourse! <em>Due on Thursday October 25 at 1:30pm.</em>
