<h2> Abstract</h2>
Here we describe a work-in-progress approach for learning valencies of
verbs in a morphologically rich language using only a morphological analyzer
and an unannotated corpus. We will compare the results from applying this
approach to an unannotated Arabic corpus with those achieved by processing the
same text in treebank form. The approach will then be applied to an unannotated
corpus from Quechua, a morphologically rich but resource-scarce language.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction and approach</h2>
When constructing NLP systems for a new language, we often want to know the
valence of its verbs, which is to say how many and which types of arguments
each verb may combine with. This information is especially helpful in
constructing stochastic parsers [<a href="#przepiorkowski" name="CITEprzepiorkowski">7</a>]. Some dictionaries may
provide such information, but even assuming that a broad-coverage digital
dictionary exists for a given language, that dictionary may not say whether
arguments are optional for a given verb, or how often they occur.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An empirical approach based on a corpus or treebank allows us to learn the
relative frequency with which a given verb takes specific types of arguments.
As a simple example from English, we would like to learn that while "eat"
usually has a direct object, "put" nearly always has one.  In order to
automatically learn this information for resource-scarce, morphologically rich
languages, we are currently implementing a system that requires only an
unannotated corpus and a morphological analyzer; other recent approaches have
required more syntactic knowledge, in the form of treebanks, parsers, or
chunkers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our approach starts by processing each sentence in the corpus with the
morphological analyzer, and finding all of the verbs. For sentences with only
one verb, we then count the occurrences of nouns that seem to be, because of
inflection, the arguments of the verb, and also words that are plausible
candidates to be the verb's arguments, where "plausibility" will be determined
by a small number of language-specific heuristics. For example, a noun
inflected with the accusative case in a sentence with a verb and a clear
subject will likely be the object of that verb. This approach throws away the
information provided by more complex sentences (those with multiple verbs and
embedded clauses), but it does not require syntactic analysis, either by a
human or a parser, and will hopefully approximate the frequencies that would be
learned from a deeper syntactic look.  Noisy observations will be filtered out
using an approach similar to the one described by Przepi&#243;rkowski
[<a href="#przepiorkowski" name="CITEprzepiorkowski">7</a>].  For consistency with other work, we will adopt the
valency theory used by Bielický and Smrž in their 2008 work, which records
whether a given verb usage contains an explicit Actor, Addressee, Patient,
Effect, and Origin.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We would like to apply the technique to Quechua because of our medium-term goal
of developing an MT system for it; Quechua is spoken by roughly 10 million
people in the Andean region of South America, and is thus the largest
indigenous language of the Americas [<a href="#fontllitjos" name="CITEfontllitjos">4</a>]. Quechua encodes rather
a lot of information into its verbs, including optional evidentiality. In many
cases the verb's arguments are included in a suffix, although notably not when
the objects are in the third person [<a href="#serafin" name="CITEserafin">5</a>].
For the Quechua morphological analyzer, we will
use Michael Gasser's <tt>AntiMorfo</tt> system [<a href="#gasser:antimorfo" name="CITEgasser:antimorfo">3</a>], which can
analyze Quechua verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Also, we have been graciously
provided with the Quechua corpus collected by CMU's AVENUE project, described
in [<a href="#fontllitjos" name="CITEfontllitjos">4</a>].  However, to evaluate our work, we would like to use a
treebank, wherein the objects of each of the verbs in a sentence may be easily
found and the occurrences of objects counted. As far as we know, there is not
yet a large treebank of Quechua, although Rios et al. have constructed a small
one [<a href="#rios" name="CITErios">6</a>]. As the work progresses, we will make note of the
differences in the distributions of verb usages between sentences with only one
verb, which the system will be able to handle without use of a treebank, and
sentences with multiple verbs and embedded clauses, which we will not try to
handle without a deep parser.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation</h2>
In order to determine the efficacy of our approach, we will apply it to Arabic,
another morphologically rich language, which has more available resources. We
will analyze the morphology of Arabic verbs using Pierrick Brihaye's <tt>
Aramorph</tt>, a port of the Buckwalter morphological analyzer that natively
supports Unicode text [<a href="#brihaye" name="CITEbrihaye">2</a>]. For the Arabic text and treebank, we will
use the newswire data in the Arabic Penn Treebank, Part 1, Version 3, which has
both Arabic text in SGML format and as parsed trees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This will allow us to compare the valencies learned from the unannotated corpus
with those that are more directly observable from the treebank, since each
verb's arguments will be easier to find with syntactic information. If the
valencies that we discover with the unannotated approach are close to those
learned from the treebank, and we get a broad coverage over the verbs observed
in the corpus, then this would provide an argument that the technique works
fairly well for Arabic, and we could continue using it as we acquire more
textual data for more under-resourced languages. 
We'll additionally report on the distribution of verbs in our Quechua data, and
how many of them occur in one-clause sentences as opposed to sentences with
multiple verbs.
